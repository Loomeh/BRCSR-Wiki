# â–¶ Mod Setup

## Mod Manager

The first recommended action to take while modding BRC is to install the [r2modman mod manager](https://thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/#features). While a mod manager is not required for modding your game, it will provide you with the following benefits:

* Direct mod installation
* Mod profiles to easily swap between practice sessions and runs
* Easily see if you are using the latest version of a mod

### Installation

You can follow the in-depth installation guide on the [r2modman thunderstore page](https://thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/#features).

### Profile Setup

When you first run the r2modman executable your screen should look something like this: 

<img
    src={r2mm_1}
    title="r2modman Game Search"
    alt="r2modman game selector with searchbar"
/>

From here click in the `Search for a game` bar and type "Bomb Rush Cyberfunk". From there you should be able to see the listing for BRC. Hover your mouse over the icon, click the star in the top right corner so you can easily find the game later, and click on the `Select game` button. 

Now you should be here:

<img
    src={r2mm_2}
    title="r2modman BepInExPack"
    alt="r2modman BepInExPack download page"
/>

This menu is where you can select your mod profiles. Each profile can have its own set of mods installed saving you the hassle of swapping mods in and out between practice and running sessions. As such, it is suggested to make one additional profile from the default so you can have your practice mods on one and the legal speedrun mods on another. Simply click the `Create new` button and name the profile whatever you want. 

### BepInExPack

Every mod on this wiki is dependant on this mod. **You will need to install this mod in every profile you use for BRC.** To do this, click on the profile you would like to install it under, and click the `Select profile` button. Then click on the `Online` tab under MODS. From here you should see BepInExPack pinned at the top of the list. Select it, then click the `Download` button. Make sure you follow this process for each profile you plan to use. You can select other profiles by going to `Settings` -> `Profile` -> `Change Profile`.

## Modding to Run

Okay, it's almost time to start running! However before you start it's important to understand the rules for valid speedruns that pertain to mods:

* Third party tools to rebind controls are allowed for PC runs, given that each button only has one applicable action **(no macros to automate a set of actions)** 
* Graffiti texture and name swap modifications are allowed for runs, but may lead to higher scrutiny during verification. Custom graffiti may be rejected up to verifier discretion. **Graffiti intended to help the runner gain an advantage will cause your run to be rejected**
* Character palette swap modifications are allowed for runs, but may lead to higher scrutiny during verification. Custom character palettes may be rejected up to verifier discretion. **Palettes intended to help the runner gain an advantage will cause your run to be rejected** 
* **Custom character model mods are banned in runs**
* **All other game modifications are banned**
* You can view the full ruleset of any category on the [BRC speedrun.com page](https://www.speedrun.com/brc)

:::note
If you have any questions about how your mods will affect the eligibility of your runs, ask a moderator in the [BRCSR Discord](https://discord.gg/EWCfbJDrh4). It's much better to ask them first than to get a personal best rejected!

### SpeedrunUtils

#### Installation:

This is the all-in-one mod that you'll need to speedrun BRC. It will automatically remove load times from your final time and allow for autosplitting with [LiveSplit](http://livesplit.org/), allow you to limit the frame rate to 30 frames per second (making normally inconsistent tricks much easier), and automatically mash through dialogue to save your hands during unskippable cutscenes.

You can download the mod directly through [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/#features) by going to your profile of choice, going to the `Online` tab, and searching for "SpeedrunUtils". This is the recommended method, as you will easily be able to update the mod later should a new version come out.

<img
    src={sru_install}
    title="r2modman Profile Selection"
    alt="r2modman game profile page"
/>

If you prefer to download it manually, you can do so from [Loomeh's GitHub](https://github.com/Loomeh/SpeedrunUtils/releases/).

#### Configuration:

Once you have both **BepInExPack** and **Speedrunutils** installed, click the `Start modded` button in the top left corner of the profile window. Doing so will create the config files for SpeedrunUtils. Once the game starts, you can close it then navigate to the `Config Editor` tab in the profile window. You may click on a config file and click the `Edit Config` button to edit the files directly in the profile window. The following are the namess of files and their uses:

* **FPS**: Allows you to set the default frame rate cap of the game
* **Keys**: Allows you to change the keybinds for FPS limit, FPS uncap, and auto mash toggles
* **Settings**: Allows you to adjust the size and position of the FPS display, enable/disable automash on startup, and unlock fps during loading screens
* **Splits**: Allows you to set what in-game events do/do not auto split. It is set to the any% splits by default.

Unfortunately for controller players you cannot bind controller buttons directly for SpeedrunUtils commands. You can however set a single button to a keystroke using steam controller settings (pictured below) or if you have the game on GoG you can use a program like [JoyToKey](https://joytokey.net/en/). 

:::note
Make sure the button is bound to a single keystroke. Failure to do this may invalidate your run.

That should be everything you need to start running! If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask in #technical-help in the [BRCSR Discord](https://discord.gg/EWCfbJDrh4)

## Modding to Practice

### Mod Overview

Unfortunately, the mods BRC runners use to practice are not searchable through the mod manager. You can still however put these mods on individual profiles. There are two mods that will make your life practicing runs significantly easier:

[NinjaUtils](https://github.com/Ninja-Cookie/NinjaUtils) will grant you many essential practicing features including:

* Set a map position and warp to it at any point 
* Enable fly and noclip
* Teleport between spawns (including dream spawns to go to dreams at any point in the game)
* Instantly fill boost
* FPS limiting and unlocking tools

**SaveRemover** that will stop the game from automatically saving and allow you to save manually. Press `0` to save and `z` to load (make sure you are not paused when you load your save).

Mod Installation

* go to your desired profile in r2modman, install BepInExPack, and hit the `Start modded` button in the top left corner to create the required folders
* get both of the mods together from this [NinjaMods Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u35EDssSp9zLLk2ZjJjx3gKiMoTmwOQX/view?usp=sharing)
* in the settings tab in your r2modman profile window, click on `Settings`, then click on the `Browse profile folder` to open the profile file folder
* Navigate to `BepInEx` -> `plugins` and extract the contents of NinjaMods.zip into the plugins folder. Your folder should look something like this:

<img
    src={practice_folder}
    title="Practice Folder Example"
    alt="Practice folder with NinjaUtils.dll, README.txt, SaveRemover.dll"
/>

Now if you press the `Start modded` button in your r2modman profile window the game should launch with both mods. Happy running!
